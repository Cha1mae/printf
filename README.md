0x11. C - printf
The printf() function is used to display output on the screen. It takes a format string as its first argument, which contains a combination of literal text and format specifiers. The format specifiers start with a percent sign (%) and are followed by a character that represents the type of the argument to be displayed.

For example, if you want to display the value of a variable num, you can include a format specifier in the format string like this: printf("The value of num is %d", num);. Here, %d is the format specifier for an integer.

The printf() function replaces each format specifier with the corresponding argument value and displays the result on the screen. The order of the format specifiers in the format string should match the order of the additional arguments passed to printf().

It's important to use the correct format specifier for each argument type to avoid undefined behavior. For instance, using %d for a floating-point number or %s for an integer can lead to unexpected results or errors.

Additionally, the format string can include escape sequences like \n for a newline or \t for a tab to format the output further.

Overall, the printf() function provides a flexible way to display formatted output by combining literal text with format specifiers that represent the values of additional arguments.
